Given a list of numbers L, implement a method sum(i, j) which returns the sum
from the sublist L[i:j] (including i, excluding j).

For example, given L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum(1, 3) should return sum([2, 3]),
which is 5.

You can assume that you can do some pre-processing. sum() should be optimized
over the pre-processing step.
